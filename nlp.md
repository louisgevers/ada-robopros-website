# Exploring movie plots
To answer our research question on how plots are structured and if they differ across **industries**, **decades** and **genre**, we created an NLP piplinte to: 
1. Study the words using in plots
2. Compare them across the different diversity attributes 
3. Perform semantic analysis and check for summilarities 
4. Propose a method to extract keypoints from summaries.
